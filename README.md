# PSOC&trade; Control C1 MCU: VADC multi-trigger conversion

This code example demonstrates timer-triggered ADC sampling using two VADC groups on PSOC&trade; Control C1. A CCU8 slice generates compare-match events that trigger VADC conversions, and the firmware prints the conversion results continuously over UART.

## Using the code example

### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*)

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target)

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**

      > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you

   b. Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box

      > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[VADC multi-trigger conversion](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-CE243082-vadc-multi-trigger-conversion)" application with the desired name "VadcMultiTrigger" configured for the *KIT_PSC1M3_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_PSC1M3_EVK --app-id mtb-example-CE243082-vadc-multi-trigger-conversion --user-app-name VadcMultiTrigger --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

</details>



### Open the project

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the debug USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the J-Link COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program**
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE

   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "PSOC C1 : VADC Multi-Trigger Conversion" is displayed on the UART terminal, followed by ADC conversion results printing continuously:

   `G0CH1: <value>, G1CH0: <value>`

   **Figure 1. Terminal output on program startup**

## Design and implementation

### Functional overview

- `cybsp_init()` initializes generated system/peripheral/pin configuration
- CCU8 slice `ADC_TRIG_HW` runs as a periodic timer source
- Compare-match-up channel 1 is routed to CCU8 SR3
- VADC background trigger input is mapped to CCU8 SR3 with rising-edge trigger
- VADC Group 0 Channel 1 and Group 1 Channel 0 are configured and powered up
- Group 1 queue is explicitly forced to external-trigger mode at runtime
- Main loop reads both result registers and prints values every 100 ms

### Resources and settings

**Table 1. Application resources**

| Resource | Alias/object | Purpose |
| :------- | :----------- | :------ |
| VADC (PDL) | `VADC_G0`, `VADC_G1` | Analog conversions on Group0/Channel1 and Group1/Channel0 |
| CCU8 (PDL) | `ADC_TRIG_HW` (`CCU80_CC80`) | Periodic hardware trigger source for ADC conversions |
| UART (retarget-io) | `CYBSP_DEBUG_UART` | Redirects STDIO output to terminal |
